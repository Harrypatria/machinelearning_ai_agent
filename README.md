## ⚙️ What’s Under the Hood?

### 🐍 Python  
The brain behind the operation. Python powers the logic, enabling seamless interaction between data, models, and the UI.

### 📊 YData-Profiling  
Drop in your dataset, and boom — instant exploratory data analysis! Get insights into missing values, correlations, distributions, and more.

### 🧠 PyCaret  
Why reinvent the wheel? PyCaret handles the heavy lifting: feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparisons — all in a few lines (or clicks).

### 🌐 Streamlit  
Sleek, interactive UI made with Streamlit. Upload, explore, train, download — all in your browser. No fuss. No mess.
